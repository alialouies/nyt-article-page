        <section id="main-text">
            <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and a
                year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
                world
                of known physics.</p>
            <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
                in the
                Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
                in the
                presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
                repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant.</p>
            <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not
                like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                Those
                particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

        <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
        <p id="img-text">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
            universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
        <section id="img-content-txt">
            <img src="still.png" alt="">
            <p class="text row-one one"><span>THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position
                in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
                there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="text row-one two"><span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> The universe is not old enough for light to have
                traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough
                time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="text row-one three"><span>DISTANT COFFEE</span> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to
                look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>
            <p class="text row-one four"><span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span> Now turn around and look a mile in the other
                direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you
                see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
            <p class="text row-two one"><span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> There has not been enough time to carry
                coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled
                from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
            <p class="text row-two two"><span>INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than
                a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
                ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                universe.</p>
            <p class="text row-two three"><span>FLUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
                ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy
                left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
            <p class="text row-two four"><span>EXPANSION</span> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
                expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
                inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
        <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation
            in his lifetime.</p>
        <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
        <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
            Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
            Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
